The entire point of prison, and all of the systems surrounding
it it all to stop crime. After someone has committed a crime,
in order to stop that person from doing any more crime you lock 
them away for a long enough period of time, that they will change,
and come out of prison a different person from when they came in.
when simplified to this degree anyone can tell you that there are 
some major problems in this system. Firstly, there is very little 
effort put into crime prevention; prison is just kind of used as 
a threat, and for most people, they are too afraid to try anything
that could get them sent there. But for those people who are 
disturbed enough to try to do something anyway, it is very hard
to stop them, only penalize them afterwards.Than the method of 
penalization is also a very poor one. The entire concept is that
people change over time, and so if you wait long enough the person
who committed the crime will change in such a way that they will 
not commit that crime, or any other ever again. If you wanted to 
influence change in someone in a positive way, the best way to do
it would be to put them in a positive environment, and let them 
become more suited to the environment, than release them,
but instead the environment we put people in is a cruel place,
surrounded with other cruel people. From my standpoint, 
this seems like a perfect wayto make even more criminals, 
because the people inside who committed petty crimes will mold
to be more like those who committed the more serious crimes. 
There are many ways to try to stop crime, and many of those 
ways make slightly more sense than the system we employ
